# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'r'` and the element `5` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'r'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `5` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
tuplex = ("S", 89, "R", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e","D")
print('r' in tuplex)
print(5 in tuplex)
```

## Result

Thus to write a python program that checks if the element `'r'` and the element `5` exist within a given tuple is created and verified successfully.
