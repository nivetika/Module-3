# Strings-Palindrome Check in Python (Without Built-in Functions)

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the string is a **palindrome** or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Take an input string from the user.
2. Reverse the string manually using slicing (`[::-1]`).
3. Compare the original string with the reversed string.
   - If they are equal, print that the string is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, print that it is not a palindrome.
4. Execute the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
a=input()
d=a[::-1]

if(a==d):
    print("The entered string is palindrome")
else:
    print("The entered string is not palindrome")
```

## Result
Thus to write a Python program to check whether the string is a **palindrome** or not, without using built-in palindrome checking function is created and verified successfully.
