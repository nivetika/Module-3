# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
def sum_list(items):
    sum_numbers = 0
    for x in items:
        sum_numbers += x
    return sum_numbers
print(sum_list([1,2,-8]))
```

## Output

## Result
Thus to write a python program that calculates sum of all elements in a list is created and verified successfully.
